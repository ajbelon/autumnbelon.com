                            <p>Create Short-Form Videos to inform and entertain the audience. Increase engagement and followers.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Process Overview:</h3>

                                </ol>
                            <h3>Process Details:</h3>

                                <ol>
                                <li><h4>Ideation</h4></li>
                                <p>Ideation can take many forms. When I'm working with a client, ideation may come from an idea or goal they have in mind. Sometimes clients and I will brainstorm together and sometimes they will come to me with a specific idea. Sometimes clients provide the assets they would like incorporated in the Short-Form Video and sometimes I source assets to utilize in the video.</p>
                                <p>When I'm creating videos for my own social media accounts, ideas may come from questions asked by followers, videos posted by mutual contacts, or projects I'm currently working on. An example of an idea that came from a project I was currently working on was building a passive solar drying rack.</p>

                                <li><h4>Staging</h4></li>
                                <p>Staging can come in multiple forms. If I am creating a live video of a project I'm currently working on completing, staging might include setting up a stable tri-pod or Gimble on location to capture video of the steps required to complete the project. If I'm answering a follower submitted question, staging might include a stable indoor tripod, Gimble, lighting, and background. If I'm creating a video using a digital video creation tool, staging includes selecting a background image and font that aligns with the business and goals of the video.</p>

                                <li><h4>Recording</h4></li>
                                <p>There are several key elements to ensure a good live recording:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Keeping the camera stable and focused on the content I want to capture.</li>
                                        <li>Maintaining good voice tone, pitch, and volume.</li>
                                        <li>Speaking in a clear manner, utilizing brevity while being explicit enough to thoroughly explain the idea.</li>
                                        <li>Ensuring the area has enough lighting to capture the images desired.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                <p>There are several key elements to creating Short-Form Vidoes using a digital creation tool.</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>That the tool is approved by the client.</li>
                                        <li>That the images utilized are either royalty free or have been purchased by the client.</li>
                                        <li>That the text utilized is clearly legible.</li>
                                        <li>That the verbage used is approved by the client, clearly explains the intended message, and is free from spelling and grammatical errors.</li>
                                        <li>That the cadence is fast enough to keep the viewer engaged but slow enough to allow the viewer time to read the text and/or view the images to fully understand the intented message.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                <li><h4>Editing</h4></li>
                                <p>Editing is an important step in creating Short-Form Videos. This is where any mistakes can be corrected, videos can be trimmed for time, and captions can be added.</p>
                                <p>When filming a live video, sometimes mistakes are made. Even with thorough planning, it is still possible to misspeak, mix words, or forget to state something. During editing, text can be added to explain or audio can be re-recorded to be more clear and more accurate.</p>
                                <p>Brevity is important when explaining a concept in a Short-Form Video. Many Short-Form Videos are 60-seconds or less, so being concise and succinct are paramount to ensuring that I stay within the time limit. During editing, I can remove any pauses and unnecessary speach such as "uh" and "um".</p>
                                <p>Editing is also the step where captions are added. To help increase accessibility, I provide captions to all my videos. Captions are usually auto generated, which frequently contain errors. Correcting errors to ensure the captions are capturing what is said is an important element.</p>

                                <li><h4>Publishing</h4></li>
                                <p>The final step is to publish the content. Publishing content at the optimal time that viewers are engaging online can help bring the message to the intended audience and increase engagement. I review native analytics dashboards and online tools to determine what the best day and time to post content might be, depending on the client and intended audience.</p>

                                <h4>Waste to Taste</h4>
                                <p>Waste to Taste is a 501(c)(3) non-profit food rescue organization. They commissioned several Short-Form Videos to help drive engagement with their Little Free Pantry Project.</p>
