                     <h1><u>Short-Form Videos</u></h1>
                    
                    <section class="topprojects">
                   
                    <p>One of the first short-form videos I made was an instructional video on how to make a Chaffle. I began the project by gathering images to demonstrate each step in the process. Next, I created a list of ingredients and constructed step-by-step instructions for each step in the process. I then gathered several examples of how Chaffles can be utilized in meal preparation to entice viewers to attempt making their own chaffles. I placed a list of dietary compliance at the beginning of the video to better explain the advantages of making chaffles. The captions were kept short and simple to effectively demonstrate in a short timeframe how to prepare this food item. I overlaid the text over the images, making sure to select a font and color that was contrasting enough to stand out against the instructional images. Finally, I selected and set the video to music that was complimentary to the style and pace of the video.
                    <br><br>
                    Making chaffles in my kitchen, I documented the steps on a notepad and took a few photos to demonstrate how the chaffles should look at specific intervals. With the steps written and images taken, I began to create a compilation in Adobe Creative Cloud Express (AKA Adobe Spark). I thought the video itself was a good demonstration of how to create a chaffle, but felt it was incomplete, lacking a full explanation of why someone would want to make this item. I located a few images of meals I’ve prepared utilizing chaffles and added them toward the end of the video to help viewers better understand how this food might be best utilized in their kitchen.</p>

                    <p>My intended audience for this demonstration was viewers with dietary restrictions, such as very low carb or gluten free. For this reason, the images I shared were low in carbohydrates and free of any ingredients that contain gluten. The completed video was 58 seconds in length. TikTok limited videos to 60 seconds or less until extending the time to 3 minutes in July of 2021. For this reason, many short-form demonstration videos are under 60 seconds and viewers have come to expect that they will be able to view an entire recipe in that timeframe. I kept the video length under 60 seconds for this reason. 
                    <br><br>
                    The reason I chose to create a recipe for this food item was because I follow a very strict low-carb, gluten-free diet to combat digestive issues. Over the years, I’ve joined an online community of others who follow this way of eating as well. There are a lot of influencers who follow a very low carb or ketogenic way of eating, but most of them include ingredients in their cooking that people like me cannot incorporate in our daily lives. I wanted this video to demonstrate how to make fun and interesting food that not only tastes good, but is also good for you.
                    <br><br>
                    I've since made several more short-form demonstration style videos for my recipe website, <a href="https://www.autumnallyear.us">Autumn All Year</a>.</p>
