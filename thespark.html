                            <p>In collaboration with the writing team, create engaging content relevant to current events and student life.</p>

                                <li><h4>Pitch Meeting</h4></li>
                                <p>The Spark was a quarterly publication. Pitch meetings followed the same cadence, conducted after publication of the previous quarter's edition.</p>
                                <p>Prior to the pitch meeting, I would brainstorm topics that interested me, research current events, and compile a list of content I was considering writing.</p>
                                <p>At the pitch meeting, writers would bring ideas for the next publication and the team would discuss a theme for the upcoming edition based upon pitched content and current events. I would pitch my ideas based on the agreed upon theme and current events.</p>

                                <li><h4>Article Submission</h4></li>
                                <p>After the pitch meeting, I would write the content discussed in the pitch meeting and submit the article for review.</p>
                                <p>My process for writing is to first create a general outline of what I want to discuss in my article. With the outline complete, I begin by writing a first draft. I then read over the first draft, correcting any spelling and grammattical errors, and ensuring the content is organized in a logical and compelling manner.</p>
                                <p>Finally, I focus on creating an engaging introductory statement to draw the reader in and make them want to read more.</p>

                                <li><h4>Editing</h4></li>
                                <p>Submitted articles would be assigned to one of the editors from the editing team. The editors would review the content and make editing suggestions.</p>
                                <p>After receiving the editing team's suggestions, I would either implement their suggestions or discuss the suggestions with them for further context. After editing was complete, the article was ready to publish.</p>

                                <li><h4>Publication</h4></li>
                                <p>After editing, the final step in the process was publication. Written articles would next go to the design team for design and publication.</p>
                                <p>Several articles I wrote for <i>The Spark</i> were published in the quarterly publication.</p>
