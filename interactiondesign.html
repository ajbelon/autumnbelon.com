                        <h3>The Client:</h3>
                            <p>First and Central - a fictitious music entertainment company</p>
                        <h3>The Ask:</h3>
                            <p>Design an app for all three of the venue's locations, including:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><p>A splash/landing page.</p></li>
                                <li><p>A way for a user to sign up for an account outside of the checkout process.</p></li>
                                <li><p>A way for a user to sign in and sign out of their account.</p></li>
                                <li><p>An account page that shows user information, and a list of the tickets they've purchased.</p></li>
                                <li><p>A contact page with a form that includes at least name, number, and email.</p></li>
                                <li><p>An About page.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Central navigation.</p></li>
                                <li><p>A checkout process that accepts credit cards, Paypal, and Apple Pay or Google Pay.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Event pages and a method of navigating through the event pages.  First and Main didn't want clients to rely on Search, they wanted to make sure users saw lots of events before finding the event they were looking for.</p></li>
                            </ol>
                            <h3>The Venues:</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li><p>First and Central- Located in downtown Phoenix.  1100-person capacity.  Serves alcohol most nights - has some 13 and up shows and some 18 and up shows.  Most common genres: Rock, punk, pop, and rap. Operates 7 days a week; a band is booked 95% of the nights, some nights with more than one band.</p></li>
                                <li><p>The Warehouse - Located near Mill Ave in Tempe, within walking distance of ASU.  500-person capacity. All shows are 18 and up and serves alcohol.  Most common genres: Punk, Rock, Rap, Pop, Experimental Music and Pop Punk.  Tuesdays are local band nights where local non-cover bands can get on the stage. Operates 7 days a week; a band is booked 85% of the nights, some nights with more than one band.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Rio West - Located near the Westgate area in Glendale, pretty close to the Cardinals stadium.  200-person capacity.  All shows are 18 and up and serves alcohol.  The Valley's place for cover bands, Rio West brings in cover bands from all genres but the most common are classic rock and heavy metal. Operates 5 days a week (Wed-Sun); a band is booked 50% of nights, one band per night.</p></li>
                            </ol>
                            <h3>Important features/asks:</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li><p>The website should allow a user to narrow down by genre when searching for tickets.</p></li>
                                <li><p>The website should have a calendar page that shows all events and allows the user to pick a day and see just the events on that day, or select a single event from that calendar page and go to the event page to purchase tickets.  Should also be able to see the calendar for all 3 venues at the same time, and a way to filter down to a single venue.</p></li>
                                <li><p>New Year's Eve is a big deal at all three locations so the owner would like a big graphic on the home page advertising the New Year's Eve parties (which can probably repurpose for when bigger bands are playing).</p></li>
                                <li><p>The owner said: "I would like the ability for a customer to rent the facility for an event.  It isn't as important as the events that I book, but if someone wants to get married at First and Central, or throw a giant bash at Rio West, I'll take their money and crank up the speakers for them.  I think we will need to just talk to them in person about their event. So maybe make sure the date they want is open, and if it is, collect their name, email, and phone number, and what kind of event it is.  If the date isn't open, ask if they are flexible and get a date range along with their contact info for me."</p></li>
                                <li><p>There is free parking within walking distance at all three venues.  It would be cool if the app had a page that showed parking for each location.</p></li>
                            </ol>
                            <h3>Event Page Requirements:</h3>

                                <li><p>Event Description.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Event Images and Video.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Next, I constructed a Survey to compile site user metrics, which I used to create User Personas.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Add tickets to cart.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Grouping of additional events such as  "Other customers who bought tickets to this also bought tickets to these events..." or "Related Events" or something along those lines.</p></li>
                            </ol>
                            <h3>Process Overview:</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li><p>User Personas and Empathy Maps</p></li>

                            <h3>Process Details:</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li><h4>User Personas and Empathy Maps</h4>
                                <p>I designed personas from the information provided by the client relative to the pain points they expressed experiencing with their current app as well as what each venue permits. For example, one of First and Central’s venues permitted entrants that were aged 13 and up and most commonly had shows that were of the rock, punk, pop, and rap genres. Another venue only allowed entrants that were 18 and up and the most common show genres were punk, rock, rap, pop, experimental music, and pop punk.</p>
                                <p>Using Adobe XD, I created personas and empathy maps that would best represent concertgoers at each venue, relative to the information provided by the client.</p>

                                <p>Tapping the hamburger menu will load top-level menu items: Events, Location, Calendar, My Tickets, and Special Events, and a button for Home.</p>

                            <li><h4>Wireframing</h4>
                            <p>Site planning and wireframing are essential elements in good digital product design. These tools provide a mode of communication between designers, developers, and business stakeholders that aids in providing a finished product that will meet or exceed project expectations. The research that goes into the creation of these elements is essential and provides the foundation needed to ensure the site plan and wireframes will fulfil stakeholder requirements.</p>
                            <p>I began the process of creating the wireframes by gathering a list of wants and needs expressed by stakeholders. With this information, using the wireframing software Balsamiq, I constructed a series of wireframes that provided a visual demonstration of what features would be included and where each feature would be located.</p>

                            <li><h4>Business and Development Stakeholder Documentation</h4>
                            <p>And finally, I constructed Business Stakeholder Documentation as well as Development Stakeholder Documentation. The documentation was created using the standard word processing software Microsoft Word and featured differing explanations of each element depending upon whether the audience was a business or development stakeholder.</p>
