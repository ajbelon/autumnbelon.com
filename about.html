                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <img src="self.png" alt="Self">
                    
                    <p>Eight years in the high-tech corporate sphere taught me about effective collaboration and how to navigate the inner workings of teams. Ten years in the government sector taught me the importance of understanding how to succeed while operating within defined parameters. My work with children in the foster care system taught me the importance of meaning what you say and of saying what you mean. <br><br>Putting this all together, I help companies design websites that are unmistakable, unforgettable, and unbelievably easy to use. A native Oregonian and lover of all things nature, my focus is on user-centric design principles that embody the path-of-least-resistance flow and visual appeal consistent with that of the natural world. I believe effective design means accessibility to all. When Iâ€™m not designing, I love to eat BBQ, refurbish furniture, rescue dogs, and find ways to caffeinate.</p>
                    
                    <h2>My Dream Project</h2>
                    <p>I would relish the opportunity to create a space for children who are in or who have graduated from foster care, to find access to community and educational resources. One where they can easily navigate the data, find resources that will be specific to their dreams, and where they can find community leaders who are looking to match up with their skillsets. </p>
                    
                    <h2>About This Site</h2>
                    <p>As a UX/UI web developer and HTML and CSS coder, I designed this site this site with responsive web design concepts in mind.  What that means is that this site is designed to provide a consistent user experience across multiple device platforms, including desktop/laptop, tablet, and mobile. In addition to this, the design of the site also incorporates UX/UI design concepts, which means that the site is designed to be accessible by site visitors who utilize common web browsing practices, such as a mouse, as well as site visitors who utilize alternate means of browsing, such as keyboard tabs.  Lastly, the site is designed to be read visually via a standard monitor, or to utilize vision assisting software such as screen readers.
