                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I’m Autumn. Eight years in the high-tech corporate sphere taught me about effective collaboration and how to navigate the inner workings of teams. Ten years in the government sector taught me the importance of understanding how to succeed while operating within defined parameters. My work with children in the foster care system taught me the importance of meaning what you say and of saying what you mean. <br><br>Putting this all together, I help companies design websites that are unmistakable, unforgettable, and unbelievably easy to use. A native Oregonian and lover of all things nature, my focus is on user-centric design principles that embody the path-of-least-resistance flow and visual appeal consistent with that of the natural world. I believe effective design means accessibility to all. When I’m not designing, I love to eat BBQ, refurbish furniture, rescue dogs, and find ways to caffeinate.</p>
                    <h2>My Dream Project</h2>
                    <p>I would relish the opportunity to create a space for children who are in who have graduated from foster care, to find access to community and educational resources. One where they can easily navigate the data, find resources that will be specific to their dreams, and where they can find community leaders who are looking to match up with their skillsets. To me, this would embody not only my skills as a designer and developer, but also my passion as the daughter of a former child in foster care who is driven to make sure she can achieve her dreams.</p>
