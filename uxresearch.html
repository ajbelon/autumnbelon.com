                        <p>Much of the work that I do as a researcher is protected by non-disclosure agreements. I conducted the entire UX research process on my own website, <a href="www.autumnallyear.us">AutumnAllYear.us</a> to demonstrate the elements in a way that is open and accessible to the public.</p>

                        <h3>The Client:</h3>
                            <p>AutumnAllYear.us - a recipe website</p>
                        <h3>The Ask:</h3>
                            <p>Comprehensive User Experience Research resulting in Recommendations, Prototyping, and Site Testing after change implementation.</p>
                        <h3>Process Overview:</h3>
                            <ol>
                            <li>Beginning with a Heuristic Evaluation - a thorough assessment of a product's user interface - I revealed several areas of strength and several opportunities.</li>
                            <li>I next conducted a Site Inventory and Audit to identify what content exists on the site, what content is working well, and where there is room for improvement.</li>
                            <li>Next, I constructed a Survey to compile site user metrics, which I used to create User Personas.</li>
                            <li>With personas created, the next step was to create user stories to help identify what things site visitors come to the site hoping to find. It can be a useful tool for understanding what elements of a site work well, what elements are missing, and where opportunities exist.</li>
                            <li>Next, I constructed Usability Testing Materials and used them to conduct in-person Usability Tests.</li>
                            <li>Using the results from the Usability Tests, I constructed a Prototype demonstrating recommended site changes.</li>
                            <li>With Prototypes created, and with stakeholder buy-in, the next step is to conduct Prototype Usability Testing with representative site visitors.</li>
                            <li>With the prototype testing complete, I provided a detailed summary of the Research Results and Recommendations and presented them to stakeholders in a recorded Presentation.
                            </li>
                            <li>Continued research has led to iterative changes.</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                            <h3>Process Details:</h3>
                            <ol>
                            <li><h4>Heuristic Evaluation</h4></li>
                            <p>The first step was to conduct a heuristic evaluation using the Nielsen Normal Group's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design. The results revealed several areas of strength as well as a few elements that needed to be addressed in the next release of the site.</p>

                            <li><h4>Content Inventory and Audit</h4></li>
                            <p>The second step is to conduct a content inventory and audit. This is a step that can help identify what content exists on the site, what content is working well, and where there is room for improvement.</p>

                            <li><h4>User Research and Persona Creation</h4></li>
                            <p>The next step is to conduct user research and use that data to create representative users in the form of Personas.</p>
                            <p>User research was conducted via surveys. Surveys were distributed and data collected was compiled to create four representative users.

                            <li><h4>User Stories</h4></li>
                            <p>With personas created, the next step is to create user stories. User stories help with identifying what things site visitors come to the site hoping to find. It can be a useful tool in understanding what elements of a site work well, what elements are missing, and what elements may need to be changed or removed.</p>

                            <li><h4>Usability Testing Materials</h4></li>
                            <p>With the previous steps completed, usability testing materials can be drafted. These materials will be used to conduct live testing with representative site visitors.</p>
                                <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19nw2E22NgpMXjj7G7sq2al3NtCUOQqp52esNjSbEjMo/edit?usp=sharing" class="button" target="_blank">Open Usability Testing Materials in Google Docs</a>
                            
                            <li><h4>Prototypes</h4></li>
                            <p>Prototypes are interactive representations of a site that can be utilized to test a site before coding or prior to making changes to the current code. It gives designers and other stakeholders the ability to preview the changes before moving on to coding. Prototypes are also valuable tools for conducting usability testing with representative site visitors.</p>
                            <p>Prototypes are typically medium- to low-fidelity in terms of design elements (color scheme, typeface, images, and other visual assets). The goal of prototyping is to demonstrate how the site will function and what interaction will look like.</p>
                            <p>There are some elements that prototyping tools such as Adobe XD, which is what I've used here, cannot do. One of those things is to search the site. There is a search button on the site to represent where that function will exist on the live site, but it is not operational on the prototype.</p>

                            <li><h4>Prototype Testing Materials</h4></li>
                            <p>With prototypes created, and with stakeholder buy-in, the next step is to conduct prototype testing materials, which will be used to conduct site usability testing with representative site visitors.</p>

                            <li><h4>Usability Research Results and Recommendations</h4></li>
                            <p>With the prototype testing complete, it was time to summarize all the research results and recommendations. View the full presentation on YouTube or view the slides.</p>

                            <li><h4>Iterative Process</h4></li>
                            <p>Further research has led to iterative changes. The overall color scheme and site layout have been updated to better align with current trends and usability standards. Visit the live site to see how those changes have translated.</p>
