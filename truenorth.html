                        <h3>The Client:</h3>
                            <p>True North Weather Consulting</p>
                        <h3>The Ask:</h3>
                            <p>True North Weather Consulting, a meteorology and fire-weather consulting firm located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, had a website that utilized outdated technology. True North Weather Consulting was looking to have their website recoded to be brought up to current technology standards. Namely, they wanted to no longer rely upon Flash Player, which has been discontinued by Adobe, and they wanted a site that would be mobile and tablet friendly.</p>
                            <p>Working with the brand’s existing assets, I made updates to the site and re-coded it to utilize updated technology and updated the accessibility to provide a unified user experience across devices and browsers.</p>
                            
                            
                        <h3>Process Overview:</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Beginning with a Project Brief, I created this document to outline the work to be done.</li>
                                <li>With stakeholder buy-in, the next step was to create Wireframes to lay out the basic design elements and outline how the webpage will be structured.</li>
                                <li>Since True North Weather Consulting was not seeking any major changes to its site in terms of typeface, color scheme, and general layout, the next step was to code and implement the site.</li>
                                <li>Finally, with stakeholder approval, I re-coded the website to the specifications outlined in the previous steps. </li>
                                </ol>
                            
                            <h3>Process Details:</h3>
                            
                                
                            <h4>1. Project Brief</h4>
                                <p>The first step was the project brief. A project brief provides a way to track progress, identify problems, state solutions, name deliverables, and identify a timeline. It's a formal document that outlines what will be done, when it will be done, and why it will be done.</p>
                            
                                <p><strong>Project</strong></p>
                            
                                <p>True North Weather is seeking a fresh, informative, functional advertising website refresh/redesign.  TrueNorthWeather.com is hosted on the site owner’s ISP and will continue to be hosted there.</p>
                            
                                <p><strong>Client Information</strong></p>
                            
                                <p>True North Weather is a meteorology and fire-weather consulting firm located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.</p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>Weather Forecasting: client-focused short, medium, and long-range forecasts; general seasonal projections.</li>
                                    <li>Consultation: reports, meteorological/climatological analysis; expert consultation for litigation.</li>
                                    <li>Training: development and delivery of specialized courses.</li>
                                </ol>
                            
                                <p>True North Weather Consulting offers services across Canada. True North Weather’s meteorologists have vast experience across western regions including British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. In addition, True North Weather’s meteorologists are experts in high latitude meteorology and offer services across Canada’s Arctic region including the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.</p>
                            
                                <p><strong>Design Problems and Project Objectives</strong></p>
                            
                                <p>Problem: The current site utilizes outdated Adobe Flash Player, which means that their navigational menu is not visible.  This makes navigating the site and locating information very difficult and results in an unattractive warning at the top of the site advising visitors to install Adobe Flash Player, as seen:</p>
                            
                                <a class="lightbox" href="#flash">
                                <img src="images/TrueNorth/flash.png"/>
                                </a> 
                                <div class="lightbox-target" id="flash">
                                <img src="images/TrueNorth/flash.png" id="flashimg">
                                <a class="lightbox-close" href="#flashimg"></a>
                                </div>
                            
                                <p>Solution: The website needs to be updated with code that does not make use of outdated technology.  The solution would be to work with the existing brand’s assets to design and code a fully functional website.</p>
                                <p>Problem: While the current site is accessible on mobile and tablet, the overall design is not scaled appropriately for use on smaller devices.  This makes the site very hard to read on mobile and tablet as the font size becomes very small on these devices.</p>
                                <p>Solution: Create CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) code that incorporates responsive design elements, providing for a more user friendly, unified user experience across multiple devices including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.</p>

                                <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p>
                            
                                <p>Canada’s economy is extremely weather sensitive. The Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society estimates that over $100 billion of the Canadian economy is affected by weather across a wide range of sectors including agriculture, transportation, tourism, energy, manufacturing, and commodities trading . Meanwhile, the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the United States estimates that 1/3 of the US Gross Domestic Product is weather sensitive (or $4 trillion per year in 2005) . These figures underscore the economic power that weather has.</p>
                                <p>True North’s weather-sensitive clients have all come to the same realization – accurate and personalized weather services directly result in the efficient use of resources and the effective execution of any operational plan.</p>

                            <p><strong>Equipment Needed</strong></p>
                            
                            <p>Since there will not be changes to the existing brand’s assets, no special equipment such as cameras will be required.  Equipment needed only includes a desktop featuring code editing software and web development tools.  Autumn Belon will provide her own equipment for the completion of this project.</p>

                            <p>The tone of True North Weather is serious.  This is a website used by leaders of corporations, businesses, and government agencies throughout Canada for accurate information regarding local and seasonal weather patterns.  The image being portrayed is one of trust and reliability.  The font family used (Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif) is appropriate for conveying this image and will remain the font family used throughout the site.  The color scheme is appropriate for the intended tone and image and will also remain.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Limitations/Obstacles</strong></p>
                            <p>The former site designer (Quality Web Design Edmonton) is no longer operational.  As a result, no artifacts or code will be able to be retrieved.</p>
                            <p>Time is also a limitation with this project, which must adhere to the timeframe in which the course is scheduled to end, with final deliverables being due Apr 23, 2021.</p>

                            <h4>2. Wireframing</h4>
                            <p>The next step in this project was wireframing. Wireframing lays out the basic design elements and outlines how a webpage will be structured. This step is typically completed without the use of color schemes, typefaces, or other brand elements. The intent is to identify the overall structure or architecture of the information on the site and allow for any changes to easily be made prior to advancing to the next steps in the design process.</p>
