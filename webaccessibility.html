                    <h1>How Web Accessibility Drives Revenue in E-commerce</h1>
                    
                    <p><small><em>Published: Oct 4, 2021</em></small><br>
                    Designing for web accessibility increases customer reach, decreases site abandonment, and avoids court costs and other business expenses.  These elements have a profound impact on revenue potential for e-commerce businesses.  Web sites not designed for accessibility lose out on an opportunity to access the approximately 15 percent of the world’s population who is impacted by some form of disability (WHO, 2020).  Gaining access to an additional 15 percent of the population translates to an opportunity to increase sales.  Legal liability related to ADA compliance cases has increased from just 814 cases filed in 2017 to 2,523 cases filed in 2020.  The cost of defending these cases, and the cost of redesigning a website if the case is lost, are avoided by incorporating design principles that increase accessibility from design inception. 
                    <br><br>    
                    Web designers must also understand that web accessibility is about more than just designing for site visitors who have disabilities.  Forty percent of site visitors will abandon a page if it takes more than three seconds to load (Jones, 2009).  Page load time (PLT), particularly in areas of low bandwidth, is another key element to designing for accessibility.  If site visitors reach a site through well-researched and planned search engine optimization (SEO) and marketing strategies but then abandon the page due to long load times, the SEO and marketing efforts are rendered useless.  With a potential 40 percent loss of acquired site visitors at stake, web designers must understand the importance of implementing design principles that decrease PLT and site abandonment.</p>
                    <h2>Disabilities</h2>
                    <h3>Reported</h3>
                    <p>Approximately 1 billion people are living with a disability worldwide and websites that do not provide a cohesive experience for people who live with disabilities miss out on an opportunity to access these 1 billion people (WHO, 2020).  Further, about 40 percent of Americans aged 65 years and older have some form of disability (CDC, 2016).  According to the Administration for Community Living, the population of Americans over 65 is projected to grow to 80.8 million by 2040 (2021).  If the population of aged Americans continues to see a disability rate of about 40 percent, the population of disabled aged Americans will increase by least 32 million by the year 2040.  This makes understanding and planning for this sector of the population increasingly important, year over year.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Unreported</h3>
                    <p>Many people have revealed that reporting their disabilities leads to difficulties in acquiring and keeping employment (Holland, 2017).  For this reason, many people living with some form of impairment do not report their disabilities.  A study conducted by the Center for Talent Innovation revealed that only 21 percent of employees who have some form of disability report those disabilities to their employer (Sherbin &amp; Kennedy, 2017).  This indicates that the total percentage of disabled web users worldwide has the potential to be higher than reported; thus, this increases the total number of potentially impacted site users.</p> 
                    <h3>Loss Avoidance</h3>
	               <p>Between 2017 and 2020, the number of filings of website accessibility lawsuits has increased.  From 2017 to 2018, the number of filings increased 177 percent.  In 2019, the number of filings stayed relatively the same, with a small decrease of 0.01 percent.  From 2019 to 2020, the number of filings increased another 12 percent.  The total number of cases citing ADA Title III violations related to web accessibility filed in court between 2017 and 2020 was 7,851.  The total number of cases filed pertains to lawsuits filed against desktop versions of websites and does not include filings relative to mobile apps unless the suit included both a desktop version and a mobile version (Launey &amp; Minh, 2021).  Statistics for filings in 2021 are not yet available. </p>

                    If an ADA case filed against a business for how their website operates is lost, the business incurs the cost of attorney fees and costs to redesign a website to meet ADA specifications.  With website redesign project costs ranging between $5,000 to $75,000, designing for ADA compliance from the beginning has the potential for significant loss avoidance (Geek Culture, 2021, Gaeta, 2021, Technource, 2021).</p>
                    <h2>Page Load Times</h2>
	               <p>In the 2017 Broadband Deployment Report created by the Federal Communications Commission, approximately 21.3 million Americans lack access to high-speed, or broadband, internet access.  Additionally, 33 percent of residential subscribers’ internet connection speed is below the threshold for what the FCC defines as broadband (FCC, 2019).  According to FCC research, 33 percent of people visiting a site from a residential setting are utilizing an internet connection that is below the classification of high speed.  By analyzing download data, Microsoft estimates that as of 2018, approximately 162.8 million people who are internet subscribers do not use broadband services.  This is approximately 138.1 million more internet subscribers than reported by the FCC (Coldewey, 2019).  Designing a website that potentially loses as much as 40 percent of site visitors due to long page load times undermines the SEO strategies and marketing campaigns funded by e-commerce businesses.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>It is difficult to ascertain an exact number of how many web visitors have a disability that affects their ability to effectively navigate a website in the same manner that someone who does not have a disability can without assistance.  However, from the data available, we can conclude that there are visitors of websites who are affected by a disability.  If sites are not designed to provide a cohesive experience irrespective of any impairments, e-commerce businesses are at risk of losing those visitors and revenue from lost sales.  Designing for accessibility decreases site abandonment and, thus, increases potential revenue.  
                    <br><br>
                    It is also difficult to ascertain how many internet users in America who are using the internet are not utilizing broadband internet services.  Extrapolating the data to a nationwide number is increasingly difficult.  However, the data available does reveal that site visitors are accessing websites at speeds that increase page load times.  Web designers must account for this section of the population during the creation of e-commerce websites as well.  Not incorporating accessibility into website design exposes e-commerce businesses to loss of potential revenue and renders futile any efforts and funds devoted to marketing and SEO.
                    <br><br>
                    All available data reveals that designing for accessibility provides potential financial benefit of increased revenue.  ADA Title III cases are on the rise, revealing that designing for accessibility from step one of the design phase decreases potential exposure to financial losses incurred through court filings.  None of the available data points to any harm when websites are designed for accessibility; thus, designing for accessibility provides a positive or benign effect on the potential profitability of e-commerce websites and is industry best practice.  It is imperative that designers take these concepts into account when designing websites for e-commerce businesses.</p>
