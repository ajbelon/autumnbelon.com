    <div class="web-design-grid">
        <div class="web-design-item">
            <p class="credibility">
            Most small business and nonprofit websites struggle not because of visual design, but because of unclear structure, poor UX, inaccessible layouts, and content that doesn’t match how real users navigate a site. My work focuses on correcting those issues through UX-informed information architecture, accessibility-focused design, and SEO-driven content structure.
            </p>

            <h3>Strategic, Accessibility-Focused Websites</h3>
            <p>
            My approach emphasizes UX design principles, SEO-informed information architecture, user flow, and content clarity so websites are usable, inclusive, and aligned with real user behavior.
            </p>

    <div class="web-design-item">
        <h3>Recent Projects</h3>
        <p>
            Recent work includes a full nonprofit website redesign with updated color systems, layout and navigation restructuring, logo and graphic refinement, new page development, and page consolidation to improve usability and reduce friction for users.
        </p>
        <p>
            This nonprofit redesign improved accessibility by following WCAG 2.1 guidelines (<a href="#burrito-brigade">see project details</a>), making the website usable for a broader audience and reducing potential legal risk.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="web-design-item">
        <h3>SEO & Analytics</h3>
        <p>
          Beyond design, I integrate <strong>SEO best practices</strong> and <strong>analytics tracking</strong> — including Google Site Tagging and performance analysis — to ensure your website not only looks great but drives measurable traffic and conversions.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="web-design-item accessibility-note">
        <h3>Accessibility & Compliance-Aware Design</h3>
        <p>
            All web design work is informed by <strong>WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards</strong> (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C guidelines</a>), including readable color contrast, semantic heading structure, keyboard-accessible navigation, and clear content hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
            U.S. courts have increasingly recognized websites as places of public accommodation under the ADA, leading to a rise in accessibility-related litigation. As a result, WCAG-informed design has become a widely accepted standard for reducing risk while improving usability.
        </p>

                    This nonprofit redesign was built on a WordPress site using the Divi theme. Instead of a full theme rebuild, we optimized the existing framework to improve accessibility, performance, and usability.

                <li>Enabled Divi dynamic CSS & JavaScript to reduce unnecessary asset loading, improving UX and SEO</li>
