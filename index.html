    <div class="web-design-grid">
        <div class="web-design-item">
            <p class="credibility">
            Most small business and nonprofit websites struggle not because of visual design, but because of unclear structure, poor UX, inaccessible layouts, and content that doesn’t match how real users navigate a site. My work focuses on correcting those issues through UX-informed information architecture, accessibility-focused design, and SEO-driven content structure.
            </p>

            <h3>Strategic, Accessibility-Focused Websites</h3>
            <p>
            My approach emphasizes UX design principles, SEO-informed information architecture, user flow, and content clarity so websites are usable, inclusive, and aligned with real user behavior.
            </p>

    <div class="web-design-item">
        <h3>Recent Projects</h3>
        <p>
            Recent work includes a full nonprofit website redesign with updated color systems, layout and navigation restructuring, logo and graphic refinement, new page development, and page consolidation to improve usability and reduce friction for users.
        </p>
        <p>
            This nonprofit redesign improved accessibility by following WCAG 2.1 guidelines (<a href="#burrito-brigade">see project details</a>), making the website usable for a broader audience and reducing potential legal risk.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="web-design-item">
        <h3>SEO & Analytics</h3>
        <p>
          Beyond design, I integrate <strong>SEO best practices</strong> and <strong>analytics tracking</strong> — including Google Site Tagging and performance analysis — to ensure your website not only looks great but drives measurable traffic and conversions.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="web-design-item accessibility-note">
        <h3>Accessibility & Compliance-Aware Design</h3>
        <p>
            All web design work is informed by <strong>WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards</strong> (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C guidelines</a>), including readable color contrast, semantic heading structure, keyboard-accessible navigation, and clear content hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
            U.S. courts have increasingly recognized websites as places of public accommodation under the ADA, leading to a rise in accessibility-related litigation. As a result, WCAG-informed design has become a widely accepted standard for reducing risk while improving usability.
        </p>

            <p>
            I design clean, strategic websites for brands and nonprofits that need clarity, strong UX, usability, and results — not just a visual refresh. My approach prioritizes UX design, information architecture, user flow, and content clarity to ensure websites support real people and real goals.

            <div class="project-optimization-callout">
                <h4>Performance Optimization Without a Full Rebuild</h4>
                <p>
                This nonprofit redesign optimized an existing WordPress site using the Divi framework. Rather than a full rebuild, we implemented accessibility improvements, page performance optimizations, and UX-focused structural adjustments.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Compressed and resized images with Smush, delivered WebP for modern browsers, and lazy-loaded below-the-fold content</li>
                    <li>Enabled Divi dynamic CSS & JavaScript to reduce unnecessary asset loading</li>
                    <li>SEO-conscious structure and on-page SEO enhancements</li>
                    <li>WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance and keyboard-navigable interface</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Technical Scores:</strong> SEO 30/30 · Mobile 30/30 · Security 10/10 · Performance 11/30 → optimized within existing framework</p>
                <p>
                These optimizations improved speed, accessibility, and UX while preserving existing content and design assets — delivering measurable improvements without a costly full rebuild.
                </p>
                <p><em>Ongoing Optimization:</em> This project is continuously evolving — additional performance, UX, and accessibility improvements will be implemented to further enhance speed, usability, and search visibility.</p>

            <div class="web-project-details">
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This project was built as a fully custom HTML/CSS site from the ground up, demonstrating that accessibility, performance, and cohesive branding can be achieved without a CMS.</p>

                <p><strong>Scope:</strong> Designed and coded the entire site, including layout, graphics, logo creation, content organization, and accessibility-focused design.</p>

                <p class="micro-callout"><strong>Accessibility & Usability:</strong> Implemented WCAG 2.1 standards, optimized navigation and readability, ensured semantic HTML markup, and created a cohesive brand experience from logo to content.</p>

                <div class="technical-metrics-context">
                    <p>
                        The site balances visual impact and performance. With rich images, scripts, and interactive features, the page size is around <strong>4.6 MB</strong>. We optimize for speed and usability by compressing images, using modern formats, and loading content efficiently.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Technical Performance & Optimization</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bulk image compression & resizing:</strong> All photos are optimized to reduce file size while maintaining quality, helping the page load faster.</li>
                        <li><strong>WebP image delivery:</strong> Modern browsers get smaller, high-quality images, improving load times without sacrificing visuals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lazy loading:</strong> Images that are offscreen load only when users scroll to them, reducing initial load time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minified JavaScript & CSS:</strong> Extra spaces and comments are removed from code to make files smaller and faster to load.</li>
                        <li><strong>Responsive design:</strong> The site works smoothly on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops (tested with Lighthouse Mobile score: 95/100).</li>
                        <li><strong>SEO best practices:</strong> The site is structured so search engines can easily understand it, helping your pages rank better (SEO score: 65/100).</li>
                        <li><strong>Secure HTTPS & updated JS libraries:</strong> Protects users and ensures compatibility with modern browsers (Security score: 100/100).</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduced HTTP requests:</strong> Fewer separate files are loaded, which speeds up page rendering.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fast page load:</strong> The main content appears quickly for visitors (First Contentful Paint: 2.4s, Largest Contentful Paint: 6.4s).</li>
