        <div class="timeline-content">
          <h3>Diagnose Structural & UX Gaps</h3>
          <p class="credibility">
            Most small business and nonprofit websites struggle not because of visual design, but because of unclear structure, poor UX, inaccessible layouts, and content that doesn’t match how real users navigate a site. My work focuses on correcting those issues through UX-informed information architecture, accessibility-focused design, and SEO-driven content structure.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-content">
          <h3>Strategic, Accessibility-Focused Architecture</h3>
          <p>
            My approach emphasizes UX design principles, SEO-informed information architecture, user flow, and content clarity so websites are usable, inclusive, and aligned with real user behavior.

          <p>
            Recent work includes a full nonprofit website redesign with updated color systems, layout and navigation restructuring, logo and graphic refinement, new page development, and page consolidation to improve usability and reduce friction for users.
          </p>
          <p>
            This nonprofit redesign improved accessibility by following WCAG 2.1 AA-informed design standards aligned with current ADA litigation trends, making the website usable for a broader audience and reducing potential legal risk.</p>

          <h3>Apply WCAG 2.1 Accessibility Standards</h3>
          <p>

          <h3>Integrate SEO & Analytics</h3>
          <p>
            Beyond design, I integrate <strong>SEO best practices</strong> and <strong>analytics tracking</strong> — including Google Site Tagging and performance analysis — to ensure your website not only looks great but drives measurable traffic and conversions.

          <p>
            U.S. courts have increasingly recognized websites as places of public accommodation under the ADA, leading to a rise in accessibility-related litigation. As a result, WCAG-informed design has become a widely accepted standard for reducing risk while improving usability.
