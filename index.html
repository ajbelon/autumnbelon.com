                        <p>A native Oregonian and lover of all things nature, my focus is on user-centric design principles that embody the path-of-least-resistance flow and visual appeal consistent with that of the natural world.</p>
                        <p>I earned a Master of Science in Graphic Information Technology, with a concentration in user experience design principles, in May of 2022 and a Bachelor of Applied Science in Internet and Web Development in 2021, graduating summa cum laude, both from Arizona State University.</p>

                        <p>I have a passion for helping others and volunteer work. Prior to embarking on my career in IT, I worked with children who were living in foster care. My role at the foster care agency as an Inclusion Facilitator was to work with children with developmental delays to empower them for success by helping them gain life skills.</p>
                        <p>The work at the foster care agency was very rewarding and emotionally challenging. I carry those experiences forward and currently volunteer weekly with a non-profit organization called <a href="https://burritobrigade.org/waste-to-taste/" target="_blank">Waste to Taste</a>. I wrote an article about the organization and my experiences volunteering there, which was published in <a href="https://issuu.com/thesparkatasu/docs/2022_04_april_-_v4_i3/43" target="_blank">The Spark</a>, found on page 43.</p>
                        <p>I love gardening, growing my own food, and just being outdoors. Combining my love for gardening and my passion for helping and teaching others I wrote an article on Vermicompost, which was also published in <a href="https://issuu.com/thesparkatasu/docs/2022_04_april_-_v4_i3/2" target="_blank">The Spark</a>, found on page 2.</p>

I rescued her from an animal shelter when she was a year old.  She's been with me for 15 years &#10084;</p>
