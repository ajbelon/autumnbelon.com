                    <p><strong>Human-Centered</strong> is the main tenet of any well designed project. Whether designing websites, logos, or creating an entire brand strategy, ease of use is the top priority. As a UX/UI web developer and HTML and CSS coder, allowing the visual elements to come together in a way that is intuitive, requiring no explanations, is the goal.
