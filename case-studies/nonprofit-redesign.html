    <h1>Case Study: Burrito Brigade Website Redesign</h1>
    <p class="case-study-intro-summary">
        Burrito Brigade’s website was struggling to clearly communicate its mission, impact, and opportunities for involvement. Visitors faced accessibility barriers, hidden information, and unclear calls to action—making it harder for potential donors and volunteers to take the next step. This case study outlines how I restructured the site’s content, improved WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance, and redesigned the user experience using semantic HTML, responsive design principles, and measurable UX improvements.

<!-- About the Client -->
<section class="case-study-about">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>About Burrito Brigade</h2>
    <p>
        Burrito Brigade is a community-focused nonprofit providing free meals while supporting local food systems. Their work depends heavily on volunteers, donations, and clear public communication. As the organization grew, their website became harder to maintain and increasingly difficult for users to navigate—especially for people using assistive technologies or mobile devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        The redesign needed to balance warmth and approachability with clarity, accessibility, and scalability, ensuring the site could support future growth without sacrificing usability.

    <h2>Workflow Breakdown</h2>

    <div class="approach-step">
      <h3>1. Discovery</h3>
        <p>
        The project began with a comprehensive audit of the existing website’s information architecture,
        content hierarchy, accessibility compliance, and on-page UX patterns. This included reviewing heading structure, link clarity, keyboard navigation behavior, and content discoverability for primary user paths such as donations and volunteer sign-ups.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="approach-step">
      <h3>2. Design</h3>
        <p>
        Based on discovery findings, I redesigned the site’s information architecture and page layouts
        to reduce cognitive load and improve content scannability. Design decisions emphasized accessible color contrast, consistent typographic hierarchy, and clear call-to-action placement aligned with nonprofit conversion goals.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="approach-step">
      <h3>3. Development</h3>
        <p>
        Development focused on clean, semantic HTML5 markup, responsive layouts,
        and accessibility-first interaction patterns. This included proper heading levels, ARIA-friendly navigation where appropriate, visible focus states, and full keyboard operability across interactive elements.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="approach-step">
      <h3>4. Testing</h3>
        <p>
        Testing included cross-browser and cross-device validation, keyboard-only navigation testing, contrast validation, and accessibility checks aligned with WCAG 2.1 success criteria.
        Identified issues were resolved through iterative layout and content refinements.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="approach-step">
      <h3>5. Launch & Measurement</h3>
        <p>
        Following launch, Google Site Tag was implemented to track key engagement metrics, including donation interactions, volunteer sign-ups, and page-level behavior. This provided actionable data to support ongoing optimization and content decisions.
