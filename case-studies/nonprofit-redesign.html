    <h1>Case Study: Burrito Brigade Website Redesign</h1>
    <p class="case-study-intro-summary">
        Burrito Brigade’s website was struggling to clearly communicate its mission, impact, and opportunities for involvement.
        Visitors faced accessibility barriers, hidden information, and unclear calls to action—making it harder for potential donors and volunteers to take the next step. This case study outlines how I restructured the site’s content, improved accessibility, and designed a clearer user experience that supports both community engagement and organizational growth.

<!-- About the Client -->
<section class="case-study-about">

    <h2>About Burrito Brigade</h2>
    <p>
        Burrito Brigade is a community-focused nonprofit providing free meals while supporting local food systems. Their work depends heavily on volunteers, donations, and clear public communication. As the organization grew, their website became harder to maintain and increasingly difficult for users to navigate—especially for people using assistive technologies or mobile devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        The redesign needed to balance warmth and approachability with clarity, accessibility, and scalability, ensuring the site could support future growth without sacrificing usability.

    <h2>Workflow Breakdown</h2>

    <div class="approach-step">
      <h3>1. Discovery</h3>
      <p>
        The project began with an audit of the existing website’s structure, content, and accessibility.
        I evaluated how easily users could find key information such as donation options, volunteer opportunities, and upcoming events. This phase focused on identifying friction points, accessibility gaps, and opportunities to simplify the user journey.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="approach-step">
      <h3>2. Design</h3>
      <p>
        Based on discovery findings, I restructured the information architecture to prioritize clarity and action. Content was reorganized into scannable sections with clear headings, while visual design choices emphasized readability, contrast, and consistency. The goal was to guide users naturally toward meaningful engagement.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="approach-step">
      <h3>3. Development</h3>
      <p>
        The site was built using semantic HTML and responsive layouts to ensure compatibility across devices
        and assistive technologies. Interactive elements were designed with keyboard navigation
        and focus states in mind, supporting inclusive access from the ground up.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="approach-step">
      <h3>4. Testing</h3>
      <p>
        I tested the site across screen sizes, browsers, and accessibility tools to identify contrast issues, navigation inconsistencies, and content clarity problems. Feedback from testing informed
        iterative improvements.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="approach-step">
      <h3>5. Launch & Measurement</h3>
      <p>
        After launch, analytics tracking was implemented to monitor donations, volunteer sign-ups,
        and user interactions. This ensured the organization could measure success,
        identify future improvements, and make data-informed decisions moving forward.
