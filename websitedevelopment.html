                            <p>AutumnAllYear.us - a recipe website</p>
                        <h3>The Ask:</h3>
                            <p>I created this recipe website based upon my own interests. As a foodie and follower of a very specific way of eating, I wanted to create a space where I could share recipes, tips, and blog posts that explain how and why I implement this way of eating. The main elements I wanted to capture on this website were:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>A home/landing page.</li>
                                <li>Categories including food type and meal type.</li>
                                <li>Simplified recipe pages.</li>
                                <li>Short-form instructional videos.</li>
                                <li>A place for blog posts.</li>
                                <li>Visually compelling design and images.</li>
                                <li>High usability and accessibility.</li>
                                <li>A Content Management System (CMS) platform.</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                            <h3>Process Overview:</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Site Plan</li>
                                <li>Navigation Plan</li>
                                <li>Select CMS platform</li>
                                <li>Site Build</li>
                                <li>Site and Content Management</li>
                                </ol>
                            <h3>Process Details:</h3>

                                <ol>
                                <li><h4>Site Plan</h4></li>
                                <p>I began by brainstorming the elements I wanted to include on the page. I then used Card Sorting to organize the elements in a logical manner and develop the overall information architecture of the site.</p>

                                <li><h4>Navigation Plan</h4></li>
                                <p>The next step was to come up with the navigation plan. I wanted to provide site visitors with two main paths of navigation: food type and meal type. Since the website caters to individuals who follow a specific way of eating, I decided to provide food type as the main navigation menu and meal type as the secondary navigation menu.</p>
                            
                                <li><h4>Select CMS platform</h4></li>
                                <p>With the site plan and navigation plan complete, the next step was to select a CMS platform. Since the recipe website was going to require a large amount of photos and videos, a CMS platform made the most sense. I researched the strengths and weaknesses of several platforms and decided to use WordPress as my CMS for this website.</p>
